### What Works ###
  * You should be able to compile anything that uses ALLEGRO 4.2.3 or lower (and maybe even some higher) with this.
  * TEXT mode
  * Multiple input drivers (keyboard, joystick, and mouse)
  * GFX mode
  * Timers

---

### What Needs to Be Done ###
  * Sound is currently disabled but code that uses sound will compile.
